  Pipeline is a struct used as an argument in the callback functions of modules implementing the `Commanded.Middleware` behaviour.

  This struct must be returned by each function to be used in the next middleware based on the configured middleware chain.

  ## Pipeline fields

    * `assigns` - shared user data as a map
    * `command` - the command struct being dispatched
    * `halted` - the boolean status on whether the pipeline was halted
    * `response` - override the response to send back to the caller (optional)
